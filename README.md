# Longevity

![]()

Longevity is a simple, but powerful cross-platform blood pressure analysis and tracking tool written with Python.

With Longevity, you can create and update "csv" files with your daily blood pressure readings, view a time trend of your readings, or you can view a violin plot of your where your readings commonly trend toward.

Over time, I plan on adding more functionality to Longevity, such as:

* the ability to choose a time period to analyze
* the ability to choose different graph/plot types
* the ability to analyze differences in data between morning/noon/evening readings
