**Current Version: 1.0.1**

Version 1.0.1 updates:

* Added error handling for the 'Trend' button. In Version 1.0, when an empty csv file was selected and this button was clicked, it would crash the program. With the updated code, this no longer occurs, and instead, a warning note appears alerting the user to their selection of an empty csv file.
